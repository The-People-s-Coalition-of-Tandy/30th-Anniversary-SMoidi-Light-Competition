            <!-- <li>
            The submission deadline is March 21st, 2 weeks after the halfway-point between the birthdays of MIDI co-inventors Ikutaro Kakehashi and Dave Smith.
            </li>
            <li>
            Submissions should not exceed 2.5 minutes in length.
            </li>
            <li>
            ◊ All entries MUST be submitted in the form of a MIDI file (.mid) that abides to the General MIDI standard.
              <ol class="small-list">
                  <li>Engraving software such as Sibelius, MuseScore, Finale, and Dorico are all General MIDI capable and can help format & compose entries into General MIDI seamlessly.
                  </li>
            	   <li>DAWs such as Reaper, Ableton, Cubase, Logic, and Pro Tools can also generate General MIDI files, but Program Changes (ie. instrument selections) must be inputted manually. Certain DAWs may not be GM-compliant in their playback system, but that should not be a problem as long as you translate your program changes to their corresponding GM instruments. For those, there are many GM Soundfonts available which you can load into a sampler or sfz player!
                 </li>
                 <li> Here is a chart of all General Midi instruments and their corresponding Program Changes. https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/gm-level-1-sound-set
                 </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Please do not send audio files! The Coalition will record all entries on our proprietary equipment and send back the audio to all contestants. The translation of what you thought would happen and what actually does on the hardware is part of this competition.
            </li>

             No XG or GS Extension Instruments.
