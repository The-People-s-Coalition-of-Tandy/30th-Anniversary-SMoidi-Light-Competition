              Audio files will NOT BE ACCEPTED!
              All submissions will recorded using the People's Coalition of Tandy's proprietary Midi hardware and sent back to contestants in high-resolution, lossless audio.
            </li>
            <li>
              All entries MUST be submitted in the form of a MIDI file (.mid) that abides to the General MIDI standard.

                  ◊ Engraving software such as Sibelius, MuseScore, Finale, and Dorico are all General MIDI capable and can seamlessly format arrangements into General MIDI.
                </li>
              	<li>
              	 ◊ DAWs such as Reaper, Ableton, Cubase, Logic, and Pro Tools can also generate General MIDI files, but Program Changes (ie. instrument selections) must be inputted manually. Certain DAWs may not be GM-compliant in their playback system, but that should not be a problem as long as you translate your program changes to their corresponding GM instruments. For those, there are many GM Soundfonts available which you can load into a sampler or sfz player!

                 ◊ Make sure you don't use audio plugins or outboard effects!
                   The only acceptable effects will be the General MIDI standard Reverb and Chorus sends (effects 1 and 2; CC #91 and #93)!

              <!-- All submission must be General MIDI Instruments only! No XG or GS Extension Instruments!
              Please remember to embed MIDI program changes (intrument assignments)
              & ctrl change data (CC articulation, FX, etc) in the MIDI file you send in so it can work on the judge’s outboard synths! This is old-school style !
              To get started, just set your favorite composition software or your favorite hardware synth to GM and start writing!
              All inscribing softwares and DAWs are GM capable, although it can be a bit tricky sometimes! -->
<!--
              This means that you need to include Program Change messages into your .MID
              file so that our hardware knows what instruments to play!
              Also make sure you don't use plugin or outboard effects!
              The only acceptable effects will be General-MIDI-standard Roland Soundcanvas SC-55 Reverb and Chorus sends (effects 1 and 2)!
